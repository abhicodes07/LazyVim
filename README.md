## Dashboard
<samp> I am using custom dashboard for the LazyVim from nvimdev. Replace the commented line with your own custom logo.</samp>

```lua
  {
    "nvimdev/dashboard-nvim",
    event = "VimEnter",
    opts = function(_, opts)
      local logo = [[ 
              -- Your cutom logo 
      ]]
      logo = string.rep("\n", 8) .. logo .. "\n\n"
      opts.config.header = vim.split(logo, "\n")
    end,
  },
```
