## Dashboard
<samp> I am using custom dashboard for the LazyVim from nvimdev. Replace the commented line with your own custom logo.</samp>

```lua
  {
    "nvimdev/dashboard-nvim",
    event = "VimEnter",
    opts = function(_, opts)
      local logo = [[ 
              -- Your custom logo 
      ]]
      logo = string.rep("\n", 8) .. logo .. "\n\n"
      opts.config.header = vim.split(logo, "\n")
    end,
  },
```

## Theme

<samp>
  I am currently using solarized osaka theme by <a href="https://github.com/craftzdog/solarized-osaka.nvim">craftzdog</a> as it looks very cozy and vibrant.
  <br>
</samp>


```lua
  {
    "craftzdog/solarized-osaka.nvim",
    lazy = true,
    priority = 1000,
    opts = function()
      return {
        transparent = true,
      }
    end,
  }
```

## Multiple configs
<samp>If you want to use mulitple configs of Neovim and Vim such as AstroVim, LunarVim, NvChad and ofcourse LazyVim then follow the below steps. </samp>

> **A note about cloning other configs**: <samp> Clone the repository of the config you are going to use the most in the default directory of Neovim `~/.config/nvim` and clone the other repositories of different configs into their respective directories with thier names similar to thier configs.</samp>
>
><samp> for example, if you want to use NvChad on daily basis then clone it's repository into default directory `~/.config/nvim` and if you want to use LunarVim also then clone it's repository into following directory `~/.config/LunarVim` </samp>

#### 1. Update `./zshrc`
<samp>Adding the following lines in your `./zshrc` file will create a `nvims` command that can be used for accessing different configs. It shows the prompt with different available configuration. If you do not select any configuration it returns **nothing selected**. </samp>
